# libioc

**Python Library to manage FreeBSD jails with ioc{age,ell}.**

iocage is a jail/container manager fusioning some of the best features and technologies the FreeBSD operating system has to offer.
It is geared for ease of use with a simple and easy to understand command syntax.

This library provides programmatic access to iocage features and jails, while aiming to be compatible with iocage_legacy, iocell and the Python 3 version of iocage (`< 1.0`).

## Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/iocage/libiocage
cd libiocage
make install
```

At the current time libiocage is not packaged or available in FreeBSD ports.

## Documentation

- Iocage Handbook: https://bsdci.github.io/handbook
- Reference Documentation: https://bsdci.github.io/libioc

## Configuration

### Active ZFS pool

libiocage iterates over existing ZFS pools and stops at the first one with ZFS property `org.freebsd.ioc:active` set to `yes`.
This behavior is the default used by other iocage variants and is restricted to one pool managed by iocage

### Root Datasets configured in /etc/rc.conf

When iocage datasets are specified in the jail hosts `/etc/rc.conf`, libiocage prefers them over activated pool lookups.
Every ZFS filesystem that iocage should use as root dataset has a distinct name and is configured as `ioc_dataset_<NAME>="zroot/some-dataset/iocage"`, for example:

```
$ cat /etc/rc.conf | grep ^ioc_dataset
ioc_dataset_mysource="zroot/mysource/iocage"
ioc_dataset_othersource="zroot/iocage"
```

iocage commands default to the first root data source specified in the file.
Operations can be pointed to an alternative root by prefixing the subject with the source name followed by a slash.

```python
import ioc
release = libioc.Release("12.0-RELEASE")

jail_a = libioc.Jail(new=True, {})
ioc create othersource/myjail
ioc rename othersource/myjail myjail2
```

When `othersource` is the only datasource with a jail named `myjail` the above operation would have worked without explicitly stating the dataset name.

## Usage

### Library

```python
import ioc

jail = libioc.Jail()
jail.create("11.1-RELEASE")
```

### CLI

libioc has a CLI tool called [ioc](https://github.com/bsdci/ioc) that is no longer bundled with the library, but can be installed individually.
It is inspired by the command line interface of [iocage](https://github.com/iocage/iocage) but meant to be developed along with the library and to spike on new features.

## Documentation

The [API Reference (html)](https://bsdci.github.io/libioc) documenting all public interfaces of libioc is updated with every release.
The information found in the reference is compiled from Python docstrings and MyPy typings using Sphinx.

## Development

### Unit Tests

Unit tests may run on FreeBSD or HardenedBSD and require an activated ioc pool.

```sh
ZPOOL=zroot make test
```

### Static Code Analysis

The project enforces PEP-8 code style and MyPy strong typing via flake8, that is required to pass before merging any changes.
Together with Bandit checks for common security issues the static code analysis can be ran on Linux and BSD as both do not require py-libzfs or code execution.

```
make install-dev
make check
```

### Project Status (Archive)

#### 2018-09-22
Progress towards the transition of [python-iocage](https://github.com/iocage/iocage) using libiocage has been made.
Recent changes to both projects ensure compatibility running on the same host, so that it is now possible to partially utilize libiocage in iocage until a full migration is performed.
Because some changes to the command line arguments and the script output will occur, @skarekrow will continue to maintain the current implementation until users had time to follow the deprecation warnings and suggestions.

In terms of the "Advanced container management with libiocage" tutorial at EuroBSDCon 2018 the [Handbook](https://bsdci.github.io/handbook) was published.

#### 2018-08-07
libiocage is making small but continuous steps to stabilize the interfaces and become used in [iocage/iocage](https://github.com/iocage/iocage).
The project was first presented in the talk "[Imprisoning software with libiocage](https://www.bsdcan.org/2018/schedule/events/957.en.html)" at BSDCan 2018 (Video Recording on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTGc3zYToh0)).
There will be a Tutorial about [Advanced container management with libiocage](https://2018.eurobsdcon.org/tutorial-speakers/#StefanGronke) on September 20th, 2018 at EuroBSDCon in Bucharest.

Ongoing preparations at this repository and iocage ensure that the transition to using libiocage under the hood of iocage go as smooth as possible for users.
Features that exist in iocage will be further improved and tested or announced to be replaced or deprecated shortly.
iXsystems let one imagine that libiocage once finds its way into FreeNAS where it can play its full strength behind a Web GUI.

#### 2017-11-14
As of November 2017 this project is *working towards an alpha release*.
This means stabilization of command-line and library interfaces, so that proper integration tests can be built.
This phase requires manual verification and testing until reaching feature-completion and compatibility with Python [iocage](https://github.com/iocage/iocage) and prior iocage_legacy versions with [ZFS property](https://github.com/iocage/iocage_legacy/tree/master) and [UCL file](https://github.com/iocage/iocage_legacy) config storage.
